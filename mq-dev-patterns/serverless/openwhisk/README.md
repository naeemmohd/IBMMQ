# IBM MQ Samples for OpenWhisk and IBM Cloud Functions
These OpenWhisk samples are written in Node.js.

[Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/documentation.html) is a serverless open source cloud platform. It works by executing actions/functions in response to events.

These MQ Samples for OpenWhisk consist of 2 actions, 1 feed, 1 sequence, 2 triggers and 2 trigger-action rules, packaged into a single project `mqfunctions`.

The samples have been developed following [OpenWhisk documentation and samples](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/tree/master/docs).

The project is deployed with the [openwhisk deploy utility](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-wskdeploy/blob/master/docs/programming_guide.md#wskdeploy-utility-by-example) using a single "Package Manifest" YAML file `mqfunctions.yml`, to describe all the components that make up the OpenWhisk Package.

The project has a dependency on the openwhisk system package for [cloudant](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-package-cloudant ). This  creates a binding (alias) to it with the binding name `mqCloudant`, allowing the packaged `mqfunctions` actions to use cloudant functionality, by invoking cloudant actions.


## Pre-requsites
To deploy and run these samples you will need:

* **MQ server** - You can use [IBM MQ in IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/mq)
* **OpenWhisk** - You can use [IBM Cloud Functions](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/)
* **OpenWhisk CLI** - You can use [IBM Cloud CLI plugin](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/learn/cli)
* **Cloudant** - You can use [Cloudant on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant). Create a database with the name `mqfunctions`.


## Manifest
The manifest file is `mqfunctions.yml`. Sample script files have been provided that will deploy / undeploy the package using the manifest.

### OpenWhisk Components
![Components](https://openwhisk.apache.org/images/illustrations/OW-Programming-Model-Horz.png)

### Deploying the samples
Deploy from the `mq-package` directory.
If deploying to IBM Cloud, use the command line to `login` to IBM Cloud. Edit the `deploy.sh` script to provide configuration details for your queue manager and cloudant database.

The actions uses MQ REST API. If you are using MQ in IBM Cloud the connection
details will be of the form

````
export HOSTNAME="web-<something specific to your qm>.qm.<region>.mq.appdomain.cloud"
export QM_PORT=443  
````

To deploy, run

````
./deploy.sh
````

###Â Undeploying the samples
From the `mq-package` directory run

````
./undeploy.sh
````
If you make any code changes, you may need undeploy before your updates deploy correctly.


## Actions
Actions are the basic components of an OpenWhisk application. An action will take input as a json object, and will respond with output as a json object.

There are two actions defined in the manifest `mqfunctions/mqpost` and `mqfunctions/mqdelete`.

The environment variables are used to set defaults, but can these can be overriden when invoking actions with -p or -P (json file) parameters.

* **mqfunctions/mqpost** - Writes a message to a queue. If the input json contains `args.message`, then that message is written. Else a default message containing a timestamp is posted.
* **mqfunctions/mqget** - Reads a specific message from a queue. Input json must contain `args.messageId`. It is this messageId that is used to fetch a message. Output json will contain the retrieved message, in the format:

```json
{
  'messageId' : ...,
  'message' : ...
}
```

The manifest maps `src/utillib/*.js` to  `./lib/` for both actions. The actions
- Build REST call parameters
- Invoke a MQ function over the REST API
- Check the results

### Monitor the logs

You can monitor the console output from the feed and actions by running.

````
ibmcloud fn activation poll
````

### Invoking action `mqpost`

Once deployed you can invoke the `mqpost` action from the command line by running
````
ibmcloud fn action invoke mqfunctions/mqpost -p message "message posted from openwhisk action" --blocking
````

The logs should see something like
````
"stdout: Posting message to MQ Queue",
"stdout: Status code is  201",
"stdout: Message Id:",
"stdout: 414d5120514d3120202020202020202091fda061031f2740",
"stdout: Message successfully sent",
"stdout: msgid is  414d5120514d3120202020202020202091fda061031f2740"
````

To specify a queue manager name (eg. QM2) different from the manifest default run

````
ibmcloud fn action invoke mqfunctions/mqpost -p message "message posted from openwhisk action" -p qm_name "QM2" --blocking
````

### Invoking action `mqget`
Once deployed you can invoke the `mqget` action from the command line by running
````
ibmcloud fn action invoke mqfunctions/mqget -p messageId "414d5120514d3120202020202020202091fda061031f2740" --blocking
````
substituting in your messageId.

The logs should show something like
````
"stdout: Retrieving message from MQ Queue",
"stdout: Status code is  200",
"stdout: Message Id:",
"stdout: 414d5120514d3120202020202020202091fda061031f2740",
"stdout: Data found :  message posted from openwhisk action",
"stdout: Message successfully retrieved",
"stdout: msg is  {",
"stdout: messageId: '414d5120514d3120202020202020202091fda061031f2740',",
"stdout: message: 'message posted from openwhisk action'",
" stdout: }"
````


## Sequence
A sequence is a series of actions executed one after another. The output of one action becomes the input of the next action in the sequence.

A single sample sequence `mq-default-sequence` is provided, which in turn invokes the `mqfunctions/mqget` action followed by the `mqfunctions/mqpost` action. This sequence is designed to take a message off the queue and when successfull add another message. Thereby leaving a message on the queue for the next trigger round.


### Invoking sequence `mq-default-sequence`
You can invoke the sequence from the command line by running
````
ibmcloud fn action invoke mqfunctions/mq-default-sequence -p messageId "<your message id>" --blocking
````


## Triggers
Triggers are used to invoke actions when an event occurs. By themselves triggers do nothing. They require rules to connect them to actions or sequences.

The two triggers defined in the manfiest are:

* **mq-feedtimer-trigger** - Which uses the OpenWhisk system `/whisk.system/alarms/interval` to trigger every two minutes.
* **mq-feedtest-trigger** - Which registers to the feed mqfunctions/mqfeed as a subscribed trigger.


## Feed
The feed defined in the manifest is `mqfunctions/mqfeed`. Feeds are actions that conform to a `feed` pattern. They are the provider of events to which triggers can register.

A feed listens for OpenWhisk lifecyle events from triggers.

* `CREATE` indicates a new trigger registration.
* `DELETE` indicates a trigger deregistration.
* `TRIGGER` event is an application registered event. This ensures that when the feed is triggered for anything other than a OpenWhisk lifecyle event, that it is seen as a TRIGGER event.

When the feed is invoked, it checks for registered triggers. If there are registered triggers then the feed browses for the next message on the queue. If a message if found the feed fires registered triggers sending the messageId of the next message on the queue as a parameter.

The feed uses Cloudant actions to persist the details of registered triggers.


### Pattern
The supplied feed provides a simple *Informs all subscribers when it detects a message*.
Different patterns can be integrated into the feed.

### Alternative patterns
Alternative patterns (**Note** these are not included in this repository) that you may wish to consider for the feed are:
* *detect all messages, fire single trigger with array of message Ids*
* *detect all messages, fire triggers in round robin with message Ids in groups*


## Rules
Rules connect triggers to actions. The two rules in the manifest are:

* **rule-mq-fire-trigger** - Which connects the trigger `mq-feedtimer-trigger` to the feed `mqfunctions/mqfeed`. This invokes the feed every two minutes. Forcing the feed to check for registered triggers and firing them. This package registers the `mq-feedtest-trigger`, so that trigger will be fired if there is a message available on the message queue.
* **rule-mq-default-sequence** - Which connects the `mq-feedtest-trigger` to the sequence `mq-default-sequence`. It will only be fired if a message is available on the queue, and the sequence will retrieve that message and post a fresh message on the queue.

## Application flow
The flow for this OpenWhisk application is

1. `/whisk.system/alarms/interval` fires once every two minutes.
2. The trigger `mq-feedtimer-trigger` is tripped
3. The rule `rule-mq-fire-trigger` is invoked
4. The feed `mqfunctions/mqfeed` is awakened. If a message is found then
    * The trigger `mq-feedtest-trigger` is fired
    * The sequence `mq-default-sequence` is started, whereby
        - The action `mqfunctions/mqget` is invoked action followed by the
        - The action `mqfunctions/mqpost`

Note: If you deploy with `.deploy.sh` then the `rule-mq-fire-trigger` rule is disabled. If you want to enable the rule and the flow then run

````
ibmcloud fn rule enable rule-mq-fire-trigger
````


### Activation logs
To list the activations run:
````
ibmcloud fn activation list
````

To view the logs for each activation run
````
ibmcloud fn activation get <activation id>
````


## Configurations
To interact with the Queue, the feed and actions need the following MQ configuration details:

* **QM_NAME** - Queue manager name
* **QUEUE** - Queue name
* **HOSTNAME** - Host name or IP address of your queue manager
* **PORT** - *HTTP* Listener port for your queue manager
* **MQ_USER** - User name that application uses to connect to MQ
* **MQ_PASSWORD** - Password that the application uses to connect to MQ

To persist registered triggers the feed needs the following Cloudant configuration details:

* **MQ_DB** - The name of the database created in Cloudant for the feed to use
* **MQ_DB_KEY** - The key that the feed will use to persist registred triggers
* **CLOUDANT_HOSTNAME** - Cloudant instance hostname
* **CLOUDANT_USERNAME** - User name used to connect to Cloudant
* **CLOUDANT_PASSWORD** - Password used to connect to Cloudant
* **CLOUDANT_KEY** - IAM API Key for Cloudant
